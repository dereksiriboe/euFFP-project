LateXTables.pdf, contains a collection of tables formatted in LaTeX to display statistical results related to a study on the impact of Financial Fair Play regulations on European football clubs. The tables provide detailed regression results and correlation analysis, highlighting key statistics such as coefficients, standard errors, t-values, p-values, and confidence intervals.

Content Overview

Table 1: Quantile Regression Results
This table presents the results from a quantile regression analysis that explores the relationship between clubs' wins and their financial indicators, namely income and expenditure. It shows the regression coefficients for the median (tau = 0.5) along with the corresponding lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.

Table 2: Fixed Effects Regression Results
This table offers the results from a fixed effects regression model. It includes estimates of the impact of income and expenditure on the number of wins for football clubs, standard errors of these estimates, t-values, and the associated p-values. Additional model metrics such as the Total Sum of Squares, Residual Sum of Squares, R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, and the F-statistic are provided to assess the model fit.

Table 3: Pearsonâ€™s Product-Moment Correlation between Expenditure and Wins
This table reports the results of Pearson's correlation analysis, measuring the strength of the relationship between clubs' expenditure and the number of wins. The table provides the correlation coefficient (r), t-value, degrees of freedom, p-value, and the 95% confidence interval for the correlation estimate.
