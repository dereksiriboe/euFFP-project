Source1 - The aim of the paper "Financial Fair Play and Competitive Balance in European Football: A Long Term Perspective" is to analyze the effects of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations on the competitive balance within the European football industry over a long-term perspective. The results indicate that the industry, naturally dominated by a few clubs, shows a general stationary behavior, with FFP having very little impact on local competitions. The improvement in financial situations primarily occurred in a small group of firms within the big leagues, which have a strong European market orientation and strict local financial control standards​​.

The result of implementing these regulations is to ensure that clubs operate within their financial means, settle their liabilities punctually, and compete fairly, thus enhancing the overall health and sustainability of European club football.

The report highlights that the cumulative revenue of the Money League clubs surpassed €10 billion for the first time, reaching a record €10.5 billion in the 2022/23 season, marking a 14% increase over the previous year​​.

Source 4- The paper "Does Compliance with Financial Fair Play Rules Improve the Football Clubs’ Sport Performance and Their Chances to Reach UEFA Competitions?" aims to evaluate the impact of UEFA Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations on the sport performance and chances of football clubs to qualify for UEFA competitions. The results reveal that greater financial responsibility, as indicated by lower Wage-to-Revenue Ratios (WRR), leads to better sport performance and increased chances of qualifying for the Champions and Europa Leagues​​.

Source 5- The aim of the paper "Financial Fair Play in European Football" is to assess the compatibility of UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations with EU law by examining their impact on the finances and sports results of European clubs, using a model to simulate the effects on four major leagues under the assumption that FFP applied to the 2010 or 2011 season. The results suggest that the break-even rule of FFP could lead to increased profitability for clubs by reducing wage spending, but it also likely reinforces the competitive advantages of incumbent top teams, raising questions about its compatibility with EU competition law due to its potential anti-competitive effects​​.

Source 6- The aim of the study "Financial Fair Play and Competitive Balance in the Premier League" was to examine the impact of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations on competitive balance in the English Premier League. The result revealed that FFP regulations have not caused a decline in competitive balance in the league but hint at a potential positive effect, emphasizing the regulations' importance for the future stability of club football​​.

Source 7- The paper titled "The effectiveness of UEFA Financial Fair-Play: Evidence from England and France 2008-2018" by François, Dermit-Richard, Plumley, Wilson, and Heutte, aims to assess the impact of UEFA's Financial Fair-Play (FFP) regulations, specifically the break-even requirement, on football clubs in England and France between 2008 and 2018. Using data from 395 club-year observations across both countries' top football leagues, the study investigates changes in clubs' profitability and cost efficiency before and after the implementation of FFP. The findings reveal a notable increase in the profitability of English Premier League clubs, both in terms of operating and break-even results. However, in France's Ligue 1, significant improvements were only observed in the break-even results of clubs not regularly participating in European competitions. The study also found a decrease in player expenditure ratios in the English Premier League, except for clubs regularly involved in European competitions, whereas in Ligue 1, the reduction was significant only for non-European-oriented clubs and the entire sample when trading was included. These results suggest that FFP has had a differential impact on clubs' financial health across the two countries, indicating the regulation's effectiveness may be influenced by the specific economic characteristics and orientations of the leagues​​.


Source 8 - The paper "Regression Discontinuity Designs in Economics" by David S. Lee and Thomas Lemieux serves as a comprehensive guide and introduction to the use of Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs in empirical economic research. It outlines the basic theoretical underpinnings of RD designs, discusses when they are valid or might be invalid due to economic incentives, and elucidates why RD designs are considered quasi-experimental. Furthermore, the paper delves into various methods for estimating RD designs, discussing their advantages and disadvantages, and the limitations of interpreting these estimates. Through examples from the growing body of empirical work employing RD designs, the paper demonstrates how RD can estimate program effects across a wide range of economic contexts. The authors emphasize the design's comparability to randomized experiments in terms of its assumptions and its potential for credible causal inference, making a case for its increasing importance in the toolkit of empirical economists .

Source 9- Thomas Jackson's thesis, "The Introduction of Financial Fair Play Regulations in European Football and its Effect on the Success of Clubs," investigates the impact of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, introduced by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in the 2011-12 season, on European football clubs' success. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning from the 2004-05 season to the 2020-21 season, Jackson employs a difference-in-differences methodology to assess changes in clubs' performance and financial health post-FFP implementation. The study finds that the regulations had limited success in curbing the financial expenditure of the largest salary teams and highlights a temporary improvement in performance metrics, such as points per game and wins, primarily among the smallest salary teams immediately following the regulation. Contrary to FFP's intent to reduce financial disparities and enhance competition, the largest salary teams continued to increase their spending post-FFP. Jackson's findings question the overall effectiveness of FFP regulations in achieving their intended outcomes of financial stability and competitive balance across European football leagues .

Source 10 - The paper "Vertical Restraints in Soccer: Financial Fair Play and the English Premier League" by Thomas Peeters and Stefan Szymanski examines the implications of UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations on competition within the English Premier League (EPL). The FFP rules, particularly the break-even requirement, are analyzed as a form of vertical restraint. The study employs a structural empirical model to assess how the introduction of FFP would affect competition, focusing on the impact on clubs' payrolls and revenues. The findings suggest that FFP could significantly reduce competition by decreasing average payrolls without substantially affecting average revenues. Wage to turnover ratios are estimated to decline by 8% to 15%, depending on the specific enforcement regime of the FFP rules. The paper argues that, while FFP is presented as a measure to ensure financial stability and sustainability in European football, it could also be interpreted as a means for clubs and UEFA to increase profitability by restricting competition, raising concerns about its compatibility with EU competition law​​.


Source 11 - The UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations (FFP), established to prevent professional football clubs from spending beyond their earnings and risking long-term survival, are outlined comprehensively in a Wikipedia article retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations" on February 8, 2024. Introduced in 2009 by UEFA's Financial Control Panel, these regulations aimed at curtailing financial "doping" and ensuring clubs operate within a sustainable economic framework. Despite initial sanctions including disqualifications and fines, the regulations faced criticism for potentially stifling market competition, failing to significantly reduce club debts, and maintaining the status quo among Europe's elite clubs. By 2015, UEFA announced an easing of these rules in response to various critiques and legal challenges, reflecting the ongoing debate about the balance between financial discipline and competitive fairness in European football​​.
