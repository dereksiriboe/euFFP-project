## File Descriptions
R Markdown Files
PolishedVisuals.Rmd: This file are dedicated to creating final, publication-ready visuals. They ensure that all graphics adhere to aesthetic standards and are consistent in style, color themes, and font sizes, making them suitable for inclusion in the paper.

Jupyter Notebook Files
mergingdata.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that documents the process of data cleaning and merging. It's an essential initial step in the analysis pipeline where data from various sources is combined into a coherent dataset for further analysis.

Instructions for Use
Setup: Ensure you have R and Python installed with the necessary libraries. For R, you'll need ggplot2, plm, and other packages specified within the files. For Python, ensure you have a Jupyter environment set up with libraries like pandas and matplotlib.

Execution: Open each R Markdown file in RStudio and each Jupyter Notebook in a Jupyter environment. Execute the code chunks/cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis.

Customization: Feel free to modify the code to explore different aspects of the data or adjust the visuals to fit other narrative styles.

Visualization: The "PolishedVisuals.Rmd" file is specifically tuned for creating visuals for presentations or publication. Use this as a template for creating consistent and aesthetically pleasing graphics.

Notes
Each file is self-contained, with comments and structured code for ease of understanding.
Data sources and package versions are documented for reproducibility.
Code chunks/cells include explanatory comments to guide newcomers through the analysis steps.
